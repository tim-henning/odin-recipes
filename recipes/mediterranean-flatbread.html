    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These Mediterranean flatbreads are packed with fresh flavor, piled with tomatoes, Kalamata olives, red onion,
        pepperoncini, and feta cheese.
        They look a little fancy, but are uncomplicated and perfect for a quick meal or appetizer.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 flatbreads</li>
        <li>60ml olive oil</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cups cherry or grape tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>125g olives, sliced</li>
        <li>125g red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>80g pepperoncini, sliced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese (or more to taste)</li>
        <li>Fresh oregano, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 220°C (428°F).</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix the olive oil and chopped garlic. Lightly brush the flatbreads with some of the garlic
            oil.</li>
        <li>Add the halved tomatoes, sliced olives, red onion, and pepperoncini to a bowl. Drizzle with the remaining
            garlic oil and mix gently.</li>
        <li>Evenly distribute the tomato mixture over the flatbreads. Sprinkle with crumbled feta and place them on a
            baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12–15 minutes, or until the flatbreads turn golden brown. Garnish with chopped oregano and serve
            warm.</li>
